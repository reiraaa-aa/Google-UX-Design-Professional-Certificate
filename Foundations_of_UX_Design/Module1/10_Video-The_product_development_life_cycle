# Overview

* The product development lifecycle is the process of taking a product from an idea to reality.
* Every task a UX designer carries out will be linked to one of these stages.

# Five Stages

* **Brainstorm:**
    * Focuses on generating ideas about the user and their potential needs or challenges.
    * Involves understanding the target audience and identifying their needs.
    * Research plays a key role, often involving UX researchers and writers.

* **Define:**
    * Uses insights from the brainstorm stage to narrow the focus.
    * Determines how the product will impact the user.
    * Focuses on specific product details, target audience, product functionality, and necessary features.

* **Design:**
    * Actively develops design ideas.
    * Checks the feasibility of specifications from the define stage.
    * Utilizes insights from previous stages to create user-centered designs.
    * Involves creating assets like storyboards, wireframes, and prototypes.

* **Test:**
    * Evaluates the product design based on user feedback.
    * Helps refine and improve designs.
    * Considers the interactivity of the design.
    * Involves collaboration between UX designers and front-end engineers.

* **Launch:**
    * Shares the finished product with the public.
    * Provides an opportunity to understand real-world reception.
    * May involve further iterations based on feedback, potentially returning to earlier stages.
