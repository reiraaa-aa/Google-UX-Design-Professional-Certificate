# Importance of User Needs

* Good UX design prioritizes user needs, not just personal preferences.
* Poor UX design often fails to consider user needs, leading to frustration.

# Examples of Poor UX

* "Norman doors": Doors with unclear push/pull mechanisms, highlighting the lack of user-centered design.
* Ambiguous icons in apps: Icons that require tapping to understand their meaning, when text would be clearer.

# Characteristics of Good UX

* **Usability:** Products should be intuitive and easy to use.
* **Equity:** Products should be accessible to diverse users.
* **Enjoyability:** Products should create a positive user experience.
* **Usefulness:** Products should effectively fulfill their intended purpose.
* **Emotional Connection:** Good UX design aims to evoke specific emotions in users.
* UX designers consider how users feel when interacting with a product.

# Observing Everyday Design

* The text encourages learners to observe everyday objects and interfaces.
* Analyzing designs (faucets, clothing, error messages, doors) helps identify good and poor UX.
* Learners should reflect on how designs can be improved.
