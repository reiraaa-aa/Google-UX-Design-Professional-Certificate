# Core Principles of Good UX

* Good UX design is not solely based on personal preference but on fundamental principles.
* The four key characteristics are: usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful.

# Usability

* Focuses on the ease of use and clarity of a product's design, structure, and purpose.
* Evaluation involves assessing if elements are easy to find, functionality is understandable, and tasks can be accomplished.
* Example: An airline app with a clear and easy flight booking process.

# Equity

* Emphasizes designing for diverse abilities and backgrounds, ensuring inclusivity.
* Goes beyond equality by providing tailored tools and support based on individual needs.
* Addresses the needs of traditionally underrepresented and excluded groups.
* Example: A messaging app with diverse emoji skin tones and gender-neutral avatars.

# Enjoyability

* Focuses on creating a delightful and positive user experience.
* Considers user feelings and engagement throughout the interaction.
* Enhances functionality by adding emotional connection.
* Example: A streaming app with personalized recommendations and customizable appearance.

# Usefulness

* Focuses on solving user problems and fulfilling specific goals.
* Distinguished from usability: usefulness addresses problem-solving, while usability addresses ease of use.
* Evaluation involves assessing if the design adds value, solves problems, and helps achieve goals.
* Example: A banking app with features for money transfer and bill payment.

# Key takeaway

* Good UX design is a combination of these four characteristics.
