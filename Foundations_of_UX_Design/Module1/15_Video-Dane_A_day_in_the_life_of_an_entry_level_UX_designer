# UX Critique Sessions

* Designers present their work to the team to receive feedback on how to improve the product.
* The focus is on the solution, not the designer's personal work.

# Implementation

* Once a solution is approved, it's passed on to engineers for development.

# Impact

* UX designers, especially visual designers, have a significant impact on how a product looks and functions for users.

# Meaningful Role
