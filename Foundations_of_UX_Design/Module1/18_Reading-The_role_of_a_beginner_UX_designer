# Entry-Level UX Designer Responsibilities

* **User Research:** Understanding users' backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and goals through methods like surveys, observations, and interviews.
* **Information Architecture (IA):** Deciding how a product is organized and structured to ensure intuitive user interaction.
* **Wireframing:** Creating basic outlines or sketches of a product or screen to visualize design ideas and gather feedback.
* **Prototyping:** Developing early product models that demonstrate functionality, which can be physical or digital and vary in complexity.
* **Visual Design:** Focusing on the product's appearance and understanding visual design principles to connect functionality and aesthetics.
* **Effective Communication:** Connecting with colleagues through various means, including emails, meetings, presentations, and design software, emphasizing collaboration, listening, and clear idea sharing.

# Specialist vs. Generalist vs. T-Shaped Designers

* **Specialist:**
    * Dives deep into one type of UX design (e.g., interaction, visual, or motion design) to become an expert.
    * Common in large companies with many designers.
    * Benefits include focused expertise and industry recognition.
* **Generalist:**
    * Has a broad number of responsibilities across various UX design areas.
    * Common in companies with fewer UX designers.
    * Benefits include skill diversification and the opportunity to explore different UX areas.
* **T-Shaped Designer:**
    * A specialist who also possesses capabilities in other related areas.
    * The "T" shape represents expertise in one area (vertical line) and related skills in other areas (horizontal line).
    * Combines the benefits of specialists and generalists.

# Additional Points

* Designers naturally develop a "T-shape" to some extent.
* Developing specific skills can direct a designer's "T-shape" and create new job opportunities.
