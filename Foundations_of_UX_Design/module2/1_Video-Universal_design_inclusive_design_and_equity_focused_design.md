# Shabi's Journey

* Shabi, an interaction designer at Google, focuses on scaling accessibility.
* Initially unsure about her career path due to a lack of technical knowledge, she realized the significant impact of technology and wanted to use it to help marginalized communities.
* Her internship focused on products for people with chronic pain, solidifying her passion for inclusive design.

# User-Centered Design

* The video discusses different ways to prioritize the user in design, expanding on the concept of user-centered design.

# Universal Design

* Aims to create a single product for the widest range of users and situations.
* Often described as a "one-size-fits-all" approach.
* Can be ineffective as it's difficult to meet diverse needs with a single solution.

# Inclusive Design

* Focuses on creating solutions that meet different needs, considering personal identifiers like ability, race, economic status, language, age, and gender.
* Involves researchers and designers from traditionally excluded populations.
* Described as "solve for one, extend to many," where solutions for specific users benefit a broader range.
* Emphasizes that there is no "normal" or "average" user.
* Accessibility, designing for people with disabilities, is a key aspect of inclusive design.

# Equity-Focused Design

* Builds on inclusive design by focusing on groups historically underrepresented or ignored.
* Aims to uplift excluded groups.
* Distinguishes between equality (providing the same resources) and equity (providing different resources to achieve fair outcomes).
* Involves identifying underserved groups and centering their needs in the design process.

# Importance of these Approaches

* The video emphasizes that accessibility, inclusive design, and equity-focused design are crucial for creating equitable products and should be considered a requirement, not just an option, in the design process.
