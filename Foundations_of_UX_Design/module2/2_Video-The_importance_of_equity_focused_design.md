# Equity-Focused Design

* This approach aims to ensure that designed products are accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities, with specific consideration for underrepresented and excluded groups. It goes beyond simply being inclusive.

# Forms and Sensitive Data

* Job applications and census forms require careful attention to gender and race, as they often collect sensitive user data.
* Consider whether questions about gender or race are truly necessary.
* If a question is necessary (e.g., in a census), use inclusive wording that avoids bias.
    * Example: Instead of "male, female, other," offer a wider range of choices, such as "male, female, gender-nonconforming, nonbinary," and provide a blank field for written answers.

# Gender-Neutral Restrooms

* An example of equitable design in physical spaces.
* Gender-neutral restrooms provide equal opportunity for everyone, regardless of gender identity.

# Voice Assistants

* Early voice assistants were primarily trained on male, native English-speaking voices.
* This resulted in difficulty understanding female voices and those with strong accents.
* This example highlights the importance of testing with diverse user groups to improve product inclusivity.

# Inclusive Images

* Designers should critically evaluate the images they use to ensure diverse representation.
* Avatars, for example, should consider age, race, and gender.
* Sometimes, designers may intentionally challenge mainstream images to promote inclusivity.

# Further Exploration

* The video emphasizes that inclusive and equity-focused design are complex principles and that this is just an introduction.
* The program will further explore biases and other factors impacting equity-focused design, especially during the user research discussions.
