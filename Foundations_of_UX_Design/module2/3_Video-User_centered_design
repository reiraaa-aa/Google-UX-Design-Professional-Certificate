# Importance of User-Centered Design

* The user buys and uses your product, so their needs are paramount.
* Focusing on real user problems reduces designer bias.
* Google's core value: "Focus on the user and all else will follow."

# Four Steps of the User-Centered Design Process

* **Understand:** Research and understand the user's experience with the product or similar products.
* **Specify:** Define the user's needs based on the research, focusing on the most important problem to solve.
* **Design:** Develop solutions and ideas for the product.
* **Evaluate:** Test the design with real users to ensure it solves their problem.

# Iteration

* The design process is iterative, meaning it involves building on previous versions and making tweaks.

# Real-World Example: Google Photos

* Initially designed for storing and organizing photos.
* Redesigned using the user-centered design process to make it easier for users to revisit memories based on user feedback.
