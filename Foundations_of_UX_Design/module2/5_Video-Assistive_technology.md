# Assistive Technology (AT)

* Encompasses products, equipment, and systems that enhance learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities.
* Many people without disabilities also use AT to improve their user experience.

# Examples of Assistive Technologies

* **Color Modification:**
    * Increases color contrast on screens (e.g., high contrast mode, dark mode) for users with low vision or eye strain.
* **Voice Control and Switch Devices:**
    * Alternatives to keyboards or mice for people with limited dexterity.
    * Voice control allows device interaction using voice, while switch devices replace the need for traditional input methods.
* **Screen Readers:**
    * Software that reads on-screen text aloud, including interactive elements and alt text, for users with limited vision.
* **Alternative Text (Alt Text):**
    * Text descriptions of images for users who cannot see them.
    * Also helpful when images fail to load due to low bandwidth.
* **Speech to text:**
    * Users compose text by speaking into their phone or computer.
