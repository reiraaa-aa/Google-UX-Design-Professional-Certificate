# Akhil's Role

* Akhil is a UX designer at Google, working with the Next Billion Users (NBU) team.
* His focus is on making technology seamless for first-time internet users.

# NBU Users

* These are users, primarily from countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico, who are coming online for the first time.

# Challenges and Considerations

* **Low-end Devices:** NBU users often use phones with limited storage, requiring apps to be small.
* **Data Access:** They may have limited or unreliable internet access, so apps need to function well offline.
* **Literacy:** Many may not be literate or may not speak English, necessitating multilingual or language-independent interfaces.
* **Cultural Differences:** Even seemingly simple icons, like a music note, might not be universally understood.

# Importance of Inclusive Design

* Technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their experience level.
* Not designing for first-time users is a "great disservice" to them.
