# Frameworks in UX Design

* Frameworks provide guidance on best practices and processes for solving user problems.
* They structure the design process and promote collaboration.
* UX designers use frameworks from initial idea to product launch.

# Design Thinking Framework

* A user-centered approach involving research, prototyping, and testing.
* Phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
* Iterative process: phases may be repeated to refine designs.

# Phases of the Design Thinking Framework

* **Empathize:**
    * Learn about the user's problems, wants, and needs.
    * Conduct user research (surveys, interviews, observations) and competitor analysis.
    * Avoid assumptions and rely on research findings.
* **Define:**
    * Analyze research findings to identify key user problems.
    * Create a problem statement (description of the user's need).
    * Develop a value proposition (summary of why users should use the product).
* **Ideate:**
    * Generate as many design solutions as possible through brainstorming.
    * Collaborate with team members from various departments.
    * Focus on quantity of ideas, not immediate quality.
    * Analyze ideas and create user flows.
* **Prototype:**
    * Create early models of the product to demonstrate functionality.
* **Test:**
    * Test prototypes with users to gather feedback.
    * Iterate designs based on testing results.
    * Test in various prototype fidelities, from sketches to high fidelity prototypes.
    * Test on multiple platforms.

# Prototype and Test Interconnection

* Testing occurs throughout prototype development, not just at the end.
* Early testing allows for more valuable feedback.
* Refine the prototype until it solves the user problem.

# Key Takeaways

* Design Thinking is one of many UX frameworks.
* Core principles of UX frameworks:
    * Focus on the user.
    * Create solutions for user problems.
    * Collaborate with teammates.
    * Validate designs.
    * Iterate.
