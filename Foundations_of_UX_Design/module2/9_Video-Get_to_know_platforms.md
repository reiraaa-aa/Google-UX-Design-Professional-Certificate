# Platforms

* A platform is the medium users experience a product on (e.g., desktop, mobile web, mobile apps, tablets, wearables, TVs, smart displays).

# Importance of Multi-Platform Design

* Users expect a consistent look and feel across different platforms.

# Past vs. Present

* Previously, UX designers could focus on desktop websites. Now, users access the same website on multiple platforms.

# Infinite Devices

* UX designers must now plan for a vast array of devices and screen sizes.

# Focus on One Platform First

* When building a new product, prioritize the platform that best meets user needs. Additional platforms can be addressed later.

# Consistent Brand Identity

* Maintain a consistent visual appearance and voice across platforms (e.g., Google Search on desktop and mobile).

# Platform-Specific Functionalities

* Some features are unique to certain platforms (e.g., voice assistants were initially only on mobile phones but are now integrated into various devices).

# Exciting Time for UX Design

* The increasing number of platforms provides more opportunities for UX designers to create features for users.
